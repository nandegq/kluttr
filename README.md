# Kluttr

Kluttr is a **web application connecting businesses and individuals with local waste removal services**. Users can sign up, schedule waste pickups either as a **one-off** or through a **subscription**, and gain insights through analytics on their waste habits.  

> **About the project:**  
> I built Kluttr as a personal project to practice **full-stack web development**. While my day-to-day work as a retail analyst focuses on BI tools, I wanted to learn how to design and build a web application, and apply these skills to internal analytics tools or dashboards in a professional setting.
